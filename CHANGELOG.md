# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`pnpm doctor`** — a setup-diagnosis command: offline config checks per integration
  (twitterapi / Lark / Google Drive+Sheets), plus `--live` to mint tokens read-only and report the
  granted OAuth scopes (catches e.g. a Google token missing the `spreadsheets` scope, or Lark auth).
  Exits non-zero if any check fails.
- **Content shaping (F)** — §5 item conversion (`convert:prepare` / `convert:save`) rewrites an
  approved translation into X / KOL / PR variants with per-type steering config in `conversion/`
  and a per-type few-shot flywheel; §6 channel formatting (`format` / `format:save`) renders a
  variant for X / Telegram / KakaoTalk / PR-mail with deterministic formatters and an optional
  agent refinement pass.
- **Second review (§7)** — the local dashboard gains a **2차 검수** mode to list/filter, edit, and
  approve Module F channel renderings before posting. `ChannelRendering` gains a `rendered`/`approved`
  status; new `ApproveRendering` use-case and `/api/renderings` routes; approved text is copy-ready.
- **Google Sheet data hub (§9a)** — a team-editable Sheet as the automation's data hub via the direct
  Sheets v4 REST API (reusing the Google `TokenSource`): `sheet:init` provisions the `targets`/`history`
  tabs, `targets:list` reads the distribution targets (①), and `history:record` upserts publish rows (②).
  ③ impressions and §8 wiring are follow-ups.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-15

Initial release: the end-to-end Mantle KR content pipeline
(collect → translate → review → publish), subsystems A–E, run locally per operator.

### Added

- **X data collection (A)** — Incremental tweet collection via twitterapi.io with a
  keyed per-handle watermark, soft-mark deletion, and conversationId thread grouping.
  Collect stops client-side at the watermark and caps pagination.
- **Lark data collection (B)** — Message collection over the Lark IM API on shared
  HTTP/store infrastructure. (Code + tests; live verification pending Lark app approval.)
- **Korean translation (C)** — Source-agnostic `ContentItem` model and an agent-assisted
  translation flow with living steering config in `translation/` (glossary, style guide,
  locale, few-shot). `translate:prepare` → agent fills the worksheet →
  `translate:save [--approve]`, with approved translations feeding the few-shot flywheel.
- **Drive upload (D)** — Headless Markdown publishing to Google Drive and Lark Drive:
  review docs (source + Korean) for translated items, Korean-only for approved.
  Descriptive filenames `<date>-<slug>-<id>.md`, per-drive idempotency, and failure
  isolation. `drive:init` provisions and shares the folders.
- **Review dashboard (E)** — Local web tool (`build:web` + `serve` → localhost) with a
  `node:http` JSON API over the existing use-cases and a React + Vite + Tailwind v4
  frontend to list, filter, edit, approve, and publish translations.
- **Google auth** — Selectable OAuth user-delegation and service-account strategies
  behind a shared `TokenSource`, plus `google:auth` for one-time OAuth consent.

### Changed

- Renamed `data/` → `translation/` to better describe the translation steering config.
- Reorganized `output/` into per-stage subfolders (`x`, `lark`, `translations`, `publish`).
- `drive:publish` defaults to `--target google` (Lark is opt-in).

### Fixed

- Collect stops at the watermark instead of crawling the full account history
  (advanced_search ignores `since_time`), cutting a run from ~12 min to ~2 s.
- Collect no longer aborts on a tweet missing `author.userName`.
- Google Drive uploads use OAuth for personal Gmail accounts, working around service
  accounts having no storage quota (403 `storageQuotaExceeded`).
- `google:auth` CLI no longer crashes on a late loopback request after the server begins
  closing (`server.address()` returned `null`).
- Dashboard server returns 500 safely instead of crashing when a response fails to serialize.
