## [Unreleased]

### Upgrading — action required for existing installs

`HERALD_STORAGE_MODE` is now **required** and is never inferred. A fresh clone gets it from
`.env.example`, but an existing `.env` predates it, so the cloud commands (`drive:publish`,
`drive:init`, `sheet:init`, `targets:list`, `history:record`) will fail until you add one line:

```bash
# append to your existing .env — "cloud" if Google/Lark Drive is your record of truth
HERALD_STORAGE_MODE=cloud
```

Defaulting it was considered and rejected. Defaulting to `local` would let a cloud operator run
`drive:publish`, see `local mode — skipped` and **exit 0**, and believe work reached Drive when
nothing was uploaded — the exact failure the explicit mode exists to prevent. Failing loudly once
is the cheaper outcome.

### Added

- **`pnpm status`** — a pipeline-visibility command: reads the local `output/` stores and prints a
  per-stage funnel (collected → translated → converted → rendered → published, with approved
  sub-counts) so you can see how far data has flowed. Offline.
- **`pnpm doctor`** — a setup-diagnosis command: offline config checks per integration
  (twitterapi / Lark / Google Drive+Sheets), plus `--live` to mint tokens read-only and report the
  granted OAuth scopes (catches e.g. a Google token missing the `spreadsheets` scope, or Lark auth).
  Exits non-zero if any check fails.
- **Content shaping (F)** — §5 item conversion (`convert:prepare` / `convert:save`) rewrites an
  approved translation into X / KOL / PR variants with per-type steering config in `conversion/`
  and a per-type few-shot flywheel; §6 channel formatting (`format` / `format:save`) renders a
  variant for X / Telegram / KakaoTalk / PR-mail with deterministic formatters and an optional
  agent refinement pass.
- **Second review (§7)** — the local dashboard gains a **2차 검수** mode to list/filter, edit, and
  approve Module F channel renderings before posting. `ChannelRendering` gains a `rendered`/`approved`
  status; new `ApproveRendering` use-case and `/api/renderings` routes; approved text is copy-ready.
- **Google Sheet data hub (§9a)** — a team-editable Sheet as the automation's data hub via the direct
  Sheets v4 REST API (reusing the Google `TokenSource`): `sheet:init` provisions the `targets`/`history`
  tabs, `targets:list` reads the distribution targets (①), and `history:record` upserts publish rows (②).
  ③ impressions and §8 wiring are follow-ups.
- **`pnpm lark:chats`** — lists the chats the Lark bot is a member of (id + name), so you can find a
  chat id for `LARK_CHAT_IDS` without a raw API call.
- **`pnpm lark:send --chat <id> --text <…>`** — sends a text message to a Lark chat (defaults the
  chat to the first `LARK_CHAT_IDS` entry). The foundation for §10 (Lark bot); pipeline-content
  wiring is a follow-up.
- **Explicit storage mode** — `HERALD_STORAGE_MODE=local|cloud` decides whether Drive is the record
  of truth or everything stays local. `local` needs no cloud credentials — the post-collection
  stages (translate / convert / format) never call an external API either way, and `local` also
  skips the Drive/Sheet commands with a clear message; collection still needs a key for whichever
  source you use (`TWITTERAPI_IO_KEY` for X, the Lark app credentials for Lark), independent of
  storage mode. `cloud` behaves as before. Storage mode is never inferred.
- **Sync ledger** — `output/publish/state.json` now records which drive, remote id, URL, filename,
  content hash and timestamp for every upload (legacy key sets migrate on read). `pnpm status`
  reports published / unsynced / stale counts, so an item edited after publishing is visible.
- **`pnpm archive` / `pnpm clean`** — retention for worksheets and superseded batches under
  `output/archive/<date>/`; `clean` removes archives older than 30 days (`--older-than`) and temp
  files stranded by interrupted writes, listing them unless `--yes` is passed.
- **`pnpm config:init`** — creates the steering config from the tracked `*.example.*` skeletons.
- **Documentation set** — `docs/ko/{capabilities,quickstart,team-runbook,artifacts}.md` covering what
  the project does, how external and internal users run it, and where every artifact is stored;
  `docs/README.md` records the documentation rules.

### Changed

- **The real steering config left git.** `translation/` and `conversion/` now track only
  `*.example.*` skeletons; the actual glossary, style guide and few-shot corpus are local. Routine
  approvals no longer dirty the working tree.

### Fixed

- **A stale publish can now be repaired.** `pnpm drive:publish` re-uploads an item whose content
  changed after it was published, updating the Drive file in place so its id and share link — and
  any link already recorded in the Sheet `history` tab — are preserved. Previously `pnpm status`
  could report an item as `stale` with no way to resolve it. Google Drive only; Lark Drive has no
  content-replace endpoint, so a stale item there is reported as a failure. Items published before
  the sync ledger existed carry no content hash and are never re-uploaded.
- **Lark collection (B)** — incremental re-runs no longer re-collect the boundary message. Lark's
  `start_time` filter floors to the second and is inclusive, so the API re-returned the message at
  the exact watermark instant on every run (reported as `collected 1` with no new data). The gateway
  now drops anything at or before the ms-precise watermark client-side, mirroring the X collector.
  Verified live: the Lark bot's `im:message.group_msg` scope is approved, `collect-lark` reads group
  messages, and a no-new-data re-run now reports `collected 0`.
- **Artifact paths are anchored to the repo root**, not the process CWD. Running a command from a
  subdirectory silently created a second `output/` tree; all 36 path literals now come from
  `src/paths.ts`.
- **`prepare` no longer strands an unsaved batch.** `translate:prepare`, `convert:prepare` and
  `format --refine` archive the previous `pending.json` before replacing it and write it atomically
  like every other store; `translate:save` and `format:save` fall back to an already-saved item
  instead of throwing.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-15

Initial release: the end-to-end Mantle KR content pipeline
(collect → translate → review → publish), subsystems A–E, run locally per operator.

### Added

- **X data collection (A)** — Incremental tweet collection via twitterapi.io with a
  keyed per-handle watermark, soft-mark deletion, and conversationId thread grouping.
  Collect stops client-side at the watermark and caps pagination.
- **Lark data collection (B)** — Message collection over the Lark IM API on shared
  HTTP/store infrastructure. (Code + tests; live verification pending Lark app approval.)
- **Korean translation (C)** — Source-agnostic `ContentItem` model and an agent-assisted
  translation flow with living steering config in `translation/` (glossary, style guide,
  locale, few-shot). `translate:prepare` → agent fills the worksheet →
  `translate:save [--approve]`, with approved translations feeding the few-shot flywheel.
- **Drive upload (D)** — Headless Markdown publishing to Google Drive and Lark Drive:
  review docs (source + Korean) for translated items, Korean-only for approved.
  Descriptive filenames `<date>-<slug>-<id>.md`, per-drive idempotency, and failure
  isolation. `drive:init` provisions and shares the folders.
- **Review dashboard (E)** — Local web tool (`build:web` + `serve` → localhost) with a
  `node:http` JSON API over the existing use-cases and a React + Vite + Tailwind v4
  frontend to list, filter, edit, approve, and publish translations.
- **Google auth** — Selectable OAuth user-delegation and service-account strategies
  behind a shared `TokenSource`, plus `google:auth` for one-time OAuth consent.

### Changed

- Renamed `data/` → `translation/` to better describe the translation steering config.
- Reorganized `output/` into per-stage subfolders (`x`, `lark`, `translations`, `publish`).
- `drive:publish` defaults to `--target google` (Lark is opt-in).

### Fixed

- Collect stops at the watermark instead of crawling the full account history
  (advanced_search ignores `since_time`), cutting a run from ~12 min to ~2 s.
- Collect no longer aborts on a tweet missing `author.userName`.
- Google Drive uploads use OAuth for personal Gmail accounts, working around service
  accounts having no storage quota (403 `storageQuotaExceeded`).
- `google:auth` CLI no longer crashes on a late loopback request after the server begins
  closing (`server.address()` returned `null`).
- Dashboard server returns 500 safely instead of crashing when a response fails to serialize.
